We teach a range of practices that all help you develop your health, vitality and happiness.

Tai Chi is well known as a practice that increases your ability to relax but what is less known is that for thos who practise it regularly and over a longer period it has much more wide ranging and profound effects.

Tai Chi practice gradually helps you see ways in whichÂ  you can use your body and mind more gently, it also strengthens the body and mind and so builds well being in a number of key areas.

*Mediocre medicine cures diseases; superior medicine prevents them.*

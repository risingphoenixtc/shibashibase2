  We teach a range of practices that all help you develop your health, vitality
  and happiness.


  Tai Chi is well known as a practice that increases your ability to relax but what is less known is that for those who practise it regularly and over a longer period it has much more wide ranging and profound effects.


  Tai Chi practice gradually helps you see ways in which  you can use your body and mind more gently, it also strengthens the body and mind and so builds well being in a number of key areas.


  *Mediocre medicine cures diseases; superior medicine prevents them.*

Health, and a sense of well-being are priceless.  Tai Chi Qigong exercises gently awaken and nurture the body's natural ability to heal itself, by working with the breath and the vital energy (chi) that flows throughout the body, from the soles of the feet to the crown of the head....and beyond. Qigong is a whole-body exercise, with a special focus on inner awareness and mindful stretching, releasing and bending.  The spine and lower back are strengthened and the joints, muscles and ligaments and even the internal organs are given a wholesome work-out. 

 

Qigong is both energising and relaxing and is used in many hospitals all over the world to help speed recovery after illness or surgery

 

“It is a self defense exercise that can make your body strong. In the use of this exercise, there are a hundred benefits without one harm. It is a model for the whole country to follow.”\
– Ts’ai Chueh-ming

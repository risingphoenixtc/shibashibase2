Dr. Chi began to study Tai Chi in 1937, continuing under the guidance of Master Cheng Teh-Fu, whose teacher was Li Ching-Lin, whose teacher was Yang Pan-Hou (the eldest son of Yang Lu-Chan, the founder of the Yang School of Tai Chi Chuan).  Dr. Chi was also a senior student of the famous Grandmaster Cheng Man Ch'ing.

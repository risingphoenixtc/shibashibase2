  * It is suitable for men and women of all ages. 

  * It is non-competitive, but includes techniques for self-defence. 

  * The continuous movements of the form (Tai Chi Chuan) help to relax and loosen muscles and joints, stimulate blood circulation, control blood pressure and work on the spine, strengthening the lower back.

Master Liang started his martial art career in High School in Tientsin where his physical education teacher was the famous Huang Han Hsun, a Master of Praying Mantis boxing (T'ang Lan Ch'uan).

 

In 1933, whilst attending a British Maritime Customs service training seminar in Beijing, he was able to study Tui Shou (Pushing Hands) with Yang Cheng Fu, a member of the original Tai Chi Yang family, who also taught Cheng Man Ch'ing. Liang was able to study with him for a couple of weeks but did not name him formally as one of his teachers. 

 

After a period of serious illness in Shanghai in 1946, Liang began to study Tai Chi Chuan with various students of Cheng Man Ch'ing, and began formal training with Cheng himself in 1947.  He became Cheng's Ta Shih Hsiung (Number One Chief Disciple). 

 

Master Liang died in 2002 at the age of 102.

### *Tai Chi / Qigong For Corporate Clients and Health Professionals*

*Courses and Workshops to de-stress, re-charge and improve concentration.*

Rising Phoenix offer courses and workshops to Corporate clients and Health professionals.  By working with balance, posture and awareness, individuals are helped to improve their concentration skills and focus single-mindedly on the task in hand.

Using simple and effective exercises, workshops are designed to quickly re-charge and rejuvenate participants.  When the personal environment is improved, this reflects outwards to the larger environment.

Workshops are also available to those in the caring professions, who may themselves benefit from a nurturing and compassionate set of relaxation techniques to keep in their personal toolbox.

Sessions of just one hour per week can be both time and cost-effective, while full or half-day de-stressing and rejuvenation workshops are invaluable.

Workshops and short courses can be tailor-made to suit particular timetables and needs, and may be held at company premises or any other suitable venue.

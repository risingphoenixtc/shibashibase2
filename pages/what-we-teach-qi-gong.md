  Qigong (also called Chi Kung) has been practised in China for thousands of
  years.


  * It is mentioned in the I Ching or Book of Changes, and the Classic on Internal Medicine written by the Yellow Emperor (2697-2597BC). 

  * Its purpose is to improve the flow of Qi (also known as Chi or Ki), or vital energy. 

  * In traditional Chinese medicine, if the flow of Qi is obstructed, the bones ligaments and muscles contract, leading to stiffness and ill-health. 

  * Most forms of Qigong involve gentle movement to encourage the opening of joints and the softening of tensions held in both body and mind. 

  * Exercises are accompanied by relaxed rhythmic breathing and a calm focused mind to promote a sense of stillness within movement. 

  * As we develop our practice, this overflows into everything we do. 

  * Life becomes less stressful as we begin to experience it from a point of restful stillness. 

  * When mind and body are one, we achieve a state of harmony. 

  * As we become more focused, our vital energy is not wasted - and it is renewable!




  Life is movement. The more life there is, the more flexibility there is. The more fluid you are, the more you are alive. – Arnaud Desjardins

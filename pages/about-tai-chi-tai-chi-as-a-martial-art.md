  Amongst the attributes of Tai Chi as a discipline, it is important not to
  overlook the fact that it is a martial art.  At Rising Phoenix Tai Chi, the
  applications of Tai Chi Chuan are taught, not for combative purposes, but to
  give body, substance, structural alignment and direction to the movements
  within the form.


  Often, we find that students do not understand the true essence of a posture or movement until they have explored its application in terms of a defensive (or offensive) strategy. We encourage students to work in pairs, sensing their way through subtle and even infinitesimal changes in the body's structure and dynamics.  In this way, they can help each other develop some wholesome and effective methods of self-defence as well as a more complete understanding of how we can move through daily life in a co-ordinated and harmonious way.

  Firstly, we need to let go of any preconceived ideas of what  a martial art is.  What we see on television and in films are choreographed movements, special effects and wire work, some just gymnastics.


  Martial art literally means, art of war or combat. 


  Tai Chi is an internal martial art.  Its aim is to start from the source of power and when we understand where power comes from we can then apply it to techniques.


  An internal martial art is like being microwaved - it cooks from the inside out. An external martial art focuses on repeating powerful explosive techniques -  it cooks from the outside in.


  After a long time of dedicated practice both internal and external arts end at the same place  - the source of power.


  Leverage and mass are the source of martial power.


  * Body weight .. when we release tension more body weight mass is available.

  * When we align the structure more leverage is available.


  A heavyweight boxer has more power than a lightweight boxer because he has more body weight (mass) to punch with.  A Judoka is skilled at Judo throws because he/she understands  leverage.


  The classic text on Tai Chi says: "The movement starts in the foot, is translated by the waist, and ends in the hand".  An unbroken pulse of  ground force power travels from the foot, directed by the waist and finally the hand or fist. When it lands, it has the full mass of the body behind it.  It sounds simple - so why is it we cant do it?


  One of the reasons is unconscious tension in muscles and joints, or unconscious misalignment of the body's natural structure.


  Take for example the basic punch.  When most people punch, they lift the shoulder. When the shoulder is raised out of the socket the arm cannot connect to the spine, hips, or feet.  All ground force and leverage has been lost and only the power (mass) of the arm is being used.  If you multiply this by all the possible misalignments in the structure, you now have the cause of lack of power.


  The movements of Tai Chi have a set of basic principles that encourage us to let go of the body's weight.  The Chinese call it "Sung".  This in turn increases the body mass and leverage from the feet and, when we direct this with a perfectly aligned structure, it is very powerful.


  Tai chi is slow for that very reason, when we slow things down it allows us to relax and fine tune the way we move - to move in a wave that begins in the feet.  The form requires that we move in a multitude of angles and mostly circular postures. Day by day during practice, we are fine tuning the body to align with gravity and bring the power of the ground force into a multitude of strong balanced postures.  The body regains its natural alignment with gravity to the ground and every move we make has power.


  Do not confuse the slowness of Tai Chi with how it is applied.  Slowness is the fire of our practice routine that forges iron. 


  This process also makes the body more healthy.  The result of seeking the source of power unravels all the tensions and knots we have created in the mind and body.

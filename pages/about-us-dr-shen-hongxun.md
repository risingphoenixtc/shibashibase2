   Dr. Shen Hongxun**


  **1939 - 2011**


   


  Dr. Shen Hongxun is Director of the Taijiwuxigong self healing system, part of the Buqi system. 


   


  We have been fortunate that over many years, we have received teaching and guidance from 


  Dr. Shen, a Grandmaster of Tai Chi Chuan and the founder of the Buqi system.  




  Through his teachings, we have gained insight into the healing and internal energy principles of the Tai Chi postures and forces.


   


  *Dr Shen passed away 26th October 2011, he will be sadly missed*

  * The Eighteen Exercises of Shibashi were devised by a Chinese Doctor, Hou Shen, and are now practised in many countries around the world. 

  * They are easy to learn and practice but to get the true benefit of this popular system, the exercises must be taught by someone who fully understands the internal principles of Tai Chi Chuan.

  * What appears flowing and effortless on the outside is a result of cultivating deep relaxation on the inside.  

  * Shibashi exercises unify the whole of the system in a relaxed, focused and mindful way. 

  * Unlike most forms of exercise that work on the larger muscle groups, Shibashi encourages the stretching and stimulation of the smaller muscles, tendons and ligaments in order to promote the strong elastic forces in Tai Chi.

  * Gentle stretching and releasing, combined with deep relaxed breathing encourages tensions deep in the body's tissues to soften and release.

  * Being mindful of the way we breathe and move, less of what we do becomes an unconscious reaction.  This allows us to remain calm and centred and in full control of all we do in life.

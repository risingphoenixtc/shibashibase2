  **Eight Pieces of Brocade\

  (Ba Duan Jin)**


  A piece of Chinese silk brocade was a much-treasured possession, treated with reverence and often passed down through generations. 


  The eight movements which comprise the 'Eight Brocades' are equally precious in their capacity for preserving the body's own rich tapestry in the best condition possible. 


  Practised mindfully, these simple Qigong exercises help to regulate blood pressure, stimulate the organs of the body, stretch muscles and ligaments, improve digestion and balance and help lift the spirits.


  They are invaluable in helping us maintain the 'Three Treasures':


  ***Jing*** - The essence, or, in modern terms, our DNA.\

  ***Shen*** - Spirit - the energy of the creative mind.\

  ***Chi*** - The life-force, emanating from the interaction between Yin and Yang.


  This delightful set of exercises has been around for over 800 years and, because of its simplicity, it is eminently adaptable to our modern, busy lifestyles. Given just ten minutes a day and a minimal amount of space, it is possible to fit the Eight Pieces of Brocade into the busiest of schedules.


  As a lifetime practice, the exercises promote good health, vitality and a sense of well being.  Each individual exercise targets a specific area, and is repeated a number of times, to suit tradition, or the preference of the practitioner.


  The exercises are gentle and suitable for all ages and health profiles. They can be practised in a standing or sitting position and can be adapted to suit personal needs.
